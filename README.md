# Smart Brain Client

A React App that detects, then highlights faces in web images. Including a user profile with image upload count and a Ranking Badge served from AWS Lambda as a serverless function.

Built with React.js, Node.js, Express, Bcrypt, PostgreSQL, Redis, Tachyon CSS, Clarifai Face Detection API, and all running on Heroku Servers 'synched' with GitHub.

Thanks to Andrei Neagoie for creating the ZTM Web Developer Zero to Mastery and ZTM Junior to Senior Web Developer courses which SmartBrain is based on.

Since completing both courses and further personal development I have also updated the SmartBrain app further extensively, adding numerous updates, bug fixes etc. With the fundamental update being to adapt it to run 100% remotely with Heroku hosting the site in tandem with PostgreSQL DB, Redis DB and AWS Lambda servers too.
